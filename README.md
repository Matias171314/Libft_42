# Libft – 42 Madrid
Your first C library.

## Overview
This project is about coding a **C library** from scratch, reimplementing a set of standard libc functions, along with some additional utility functions.  
You will use this library in future projects throughout your 42 cursus.

### Project goals
- Recreate standard C library functions (`strlen`, `memcpy`, etc.).
- Develop additional helper functions for string and memory manipulation.
- Learn how to build and manage a **static library** (`libft.a`).
- Understand memory management, pointers, and clean C coding practices.
- Comply with the **Norminette** coding standard.
- Optionally, implement **bonus** functions for linked list manipulation (`t_list`).

## 📦 Repository structure
```
libft/
├── Makefile
├── libft.h
├── ft_*.c
├── ft_*.o               # (object files generated by Makefile)
├── libft.a              # (compiled library)
└── test/                # (optional directory for personal testing)
```

---

## ⚙️ Compilation

To compile the library:
```bash
make
```

To remove object files:
```bash
make clean
```

To remove object files and the library:
```bash
make fclean
```

To rebuild everything:
```bash
make re
```

To compile the **bonus** part as well:
```bash
make bonus
```

---

## 🧩 Usage

1. Include the header file in your project:
   ```c
   #include "libft.h"
   ```
2. Compile your project with the library:
   ```bash
   cc main.c -L. -lft
   ```

## 📚 Functions implemented

### Part 1 – libc functions
Reimplementations of standard functions from `<ctype.h>`, `<string.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>`.

### Part 2 – Additional functions
Utility functions such as `ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_itoa`, and more.

### Bonus part
A simple **linked list** implementation using the `t_list` structure.

## 🧠 Evaluation (42 Standards)
- Your code must pass **Norminette**.  
- Memory management must be clean — no leaks are allowed.  
- The **bonus part** is evaluated only if the **mandatory part** is perfect.  
- All files must be in the **root directory**.  
- You’ll be evaluated by your peers and by **Deepthought**.
